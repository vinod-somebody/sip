        <h3>What is a SIP Calculator?</h3>
        <p>Warren Buffet has rightly said, ‘If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work
            until
            you die.’</p>
        <p>And, a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is surely that way to invest in the equity markets of India
            through
            mutual funds. It makes you financially disciplined and generates a habit of saving a little amount every
            month for a secure future. SIP calculator is a tool that gives you a general idea pertaining to the
            returns
            that you receive through your investments. Using this, you will be able to get a rough estimate of how
            much
            your financial goals will be achieved based on the annual rate of return.</p>
        <p>There are a few numerical inputs like investment amount or target amount, expected rate of return,
            investment
            tenure and step-up rate that you are supposed to fill. With these inputs, our SIP calculator can easily
            let
            you know the expected return from your SIP investment. Whether you want your output in graphical or
            chart
            format, we will serve you with the easiest approach and let you know about the investment amount,
            potential
            capital gains and maturity amount.</p>
        <p>Please note that this SIP calculator doesn’t guarantee any returns; it simply shows the estimated return
            which is hugely dependent on the performance of the fund you have invested in. The actual return may
            vary as
            it can be higher or lower than the expected return given by the SIP calculator. </p>
        <h3>How Does an SIP Calculator Work?</h3>
        <p>It uses the compound interest formula to calculate the expected returns on the investment. The formula
            which
            is used here is as follows:</p>
        <p class="fw-bold">M= P x ({[1 + i] n - 1} / i) x (1 + i)</p>
        <p>M is the total amount of money you receive at the time of maturity of the fund.</p>
        <p>P is the specific amount you invest at regular intervals every month.</p>
        <p>N is the number of payments you’ve done so far.</p>
        <p>I is the periodic rate of interest. </p>
        <p>Thus, in order to calculate the returns, you have to insert the following values:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monthly amount you want to invest</li>
            <li>Potential rate of return</li>
            <li>The investment periods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let’s see how it works through an example:</p>
        <p>For instance, if you want to invest Rs 2000 every month for a year (12 months) at a periodic rate of
            interest
            of 12%. So, the monthly return will be 12%/12= 0.01). </p>
        <p>Hence, if we insert these values in the formula like:</p>
        <p>M= 2000X ({1+0.01)(12)-1}/0.01) x (1+0.01)</p>
        <p>then we get 25,602 approximately in a year.</p>

            choice.
        </p>
        <h5>Can I pause my SIP for a specific period of time?</h5>
        <p>Yes, in case you want to stop your SIP for a specific period of time, then mutual fund companies offer
            this
            option as well. </p>
        <h5>Can I renew my SIP?</h5>
        <p>SIPs are automatically renewed which doesn’t require any effort, but if you want you can even cancel this
            auto-renew feature. </p>
        <h5>Is SIP and mutual fund the same thing?</h5>
        <p>SIP is an investment vehicle which helps you invest in your preferred scheme to meet your financial
            objectives. And, a mutual fund is that investment product in which you wish to invest. </p>
        <h5>Is SIP better or a lump sum amount?</h5>
        <p>If you have a huge amount in hand to invest, then you can surely go for a lump sum amount. But, if you
            wish
            to make disciplined investments without experiencing financial burden, then SIP is better wherein you
            will
            invest a fixed amount over a period of time. </p>
        <h5>Which is better: SIP or FD?</h5>
        <p>If you are an investor who wants to play safe or invest in a secure, predetermined rate of interest, then
            you
            would not prefer taking any sort of risk and FD is a better option. But if you have a different
            investment
            objective, risk-taking capacity, and fluctuations in returns, then invest in a right, profitable fund
            through SIP. </p>
