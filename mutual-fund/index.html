        <h2>What are the Major Types of Mutual Funds?</h2>

            different types of mutual funds. Let’s know about each of them:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Equity Mutual Funds:</li>
            <p>These funds are the schemes which invest a majority of their assets in stocks. They are considered as the
                great investment option as they have the potential for long-term wealth creation. Equity funds are
                further divided into four types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Large-cap funds</li>
                <p>These funds invest almost 80 percent of their assets in the top 100 companies given by market
                    capitalization.</p>
                <li>Mid-cap funds</li>
                <p>These funds invest 65 percent of their assets in the companies that are ranked by market
                    capitalization from 101 to 250th.</p>
                <li>Small-cap funds</li>

                    mid-cap, and small-cap stocks.</p>
            </ul>
            <li>Debt Mutual Funds</li>
            <p>These funds generate returns for their investors by lending money from corporate institutions and the
                government by buying debt papers. They are classified into different categories like money market funds,
                corporate bond funds, overnight funds, and liquid funds.</p>
            <li>Hybrid funds</li>
            <p>This type of fund is invested in different asset classes with a mix of equity, debt or gold. Aggressive
                hybrid, balanced hybrid, dynamic asset allocation funds, and arbitrage funds.</p>
            <p>There are many online mutual fund agencies or companies that offer correct financial advice, so don’t
                wait anymore and begin your quest.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>What are the Benefits of Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p><b>Investing Support by Professionals:</b> When you make an investment in mutual funds, your money is managed
            by professional money managers who hold extensive years of experience in investing.</p>
        <p><b>Power of Liquidity:</b> Mutual funds give investors the leeway to buy and sell their invested money
            anytime according to their needs. Therefore, as compared to the other instruments, mutual funds offer the
            feature of maximum liquidity.</p>
        <p><b>High Returns:</b> Unlike other traditional investment options like FD, RD, and PPF, mutual funds give high
            returns to an investor.</p>
        <p><b>Start with small money:</b> You can start investing in mutual funds with the minimum amount of Rs 500. To
            begin the investment, you need not have a large capital or a lump sum amount.</p>
        <p><b>Reduced Risk:</b> There is no denying the fact that mutual funds are subject to market risk, but as mutual
            funds invest in the basket of stocks, bonds, etc., your portfolio becomes diversified and hence there is
            less risk involved.</p>
        <p><b> Protect the investor’s interests:</b> As mutual funds are regulated by SEBI guidelines, there is no
            chance of frauds and bogus transactions. It makes every process transparent and secure for investors.</p>
        <p><b>Tax benefits:</b> When you invest in financial instruments like mutual funds, you can claim a tax benefit
            of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year in ELSS. For tax deductions, people find buying mutual funds a smart choice to
            make.</p>
        <h2>What are the Ways to Invest in Mutual Funds?</h2>
        <p>There are two ways using which you can invest in mutual funds.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan)</li>
            <p>Little drops make the mighty ocean. And, that's how SIP works too. One of the most recommended ways to
                invest in mutual funds, SIP allows us to invest a fixed amount of money in the selected fund every
                month. It helps you average out the cost at which you buy the units of the preferred funds.</p>
            <li>Lumpsum</li>
            <p>When you have a large chunk of money to invest, then you can make a one-time investment to meet your
                financial goals.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to invest in Mutual Funds in India?</h2>
        <p>You can easily invest in mutual funds online by using legit applications or companies. There are simple steps
            that make the investment process simple, convenient, and easy.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you need to sign up for a mutual fund account at a company that provides excellent financial
                services.</li>
            <li>Complete the KYC formalities</li>
            <li>Study and identify the funds you wish to invest in based on your financial objectives.</li>
            <li>Select the fund and the amount to transfer in that selected fund.</li>
            <li>Issue a standing instruction with your back in case you invest through SIP at regular intervals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Investing in mutual funds is truly an effortless way to grow your money fast and achieve your financial
            goals. From retirement plans, children’s education, child’s marriage to illness, with this investment you
            need not be worried about the financial hardships that never knock. Give it a slow start, and with time you
            will realise that your investments have grown by leaps and bounds.</p>
