        <h1>SIP</h1>
        <p>A smart investment allows you to build wealth and use your hard-earned money on a rainy day or times of
            emergency. To earn some additional income and enjoy long-term returns, there are a plethora of investment
            strategies and plans, and ‘Systematic Investment Plan’ is one of them which is taking the world by storm.
            There are many questions that pop in our heads like what is SIP? How to do SIP Online? How much to invest?
            Where to invest? If you too are struggling to find answers to these questions, then you’ve landed in the
            right place. Let’s read further and enhance your knowledge regarding this smart investment tool, i.e., an
            SIP.</p>
        <h2>What is a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)?</h2>
        <p>They say, ‘Little drops make the mighty ocean- we all have heard it several times, and now it’s time to
            experience how this saying works in the world of SIP. This tool allows you to invest a minimum of Rs 500 on
            a regular interval in your preferred mutual fund. It depends on the investor how he/she wants to invest- it
            can be monthly, weekly, quarterly or even annually. It helps you save a lump sum amount to secure your
            future or meet financial goals without putting a strain on the pocket. Over a period of time, you can create
            a huge amount of wealth using small amounts of money.</p>
        <p>In this plan, investors gain the habit of doing regular savings with a small amount of money and build a
            portfolio gradually with the passage of time. We all have heard that consistency is the key, and SIP makes
            it come true by making us learn that consistency in investment can truly help you achieve your long-term
            financial objectives.</p>
        <h3>How Does an SIP Work?</h3>
        <p>Before you make up your mind to invest in SIP, it’s essential for you to understand how it works. The
            Systematic Investment Plan works on regular intervals or consistent investments, which seems like a
            recurring bank deposit. The specific amount of money you want to invest will automatically be debited from
            your bank account on the selected date of the month, and you’ll be allotted the units based on the selected
            mutual fund’s current Net Asset Value (NAV).</p>
        <p>For instance, if you’ve decided to invest Rs 1000 and have selected the 10th of every month as the SIP
            deduction date, then the same amount will be deducted on the 10th of every month only and will be invested
            in the chosen mutual fund. In exchange of the amount paid to mutual funds, it allots you the number of
            units. Let’s assume that the NAV for your selected mutual fund is currently Rs 25. Now if you invest 1000 in
            that mutual fund, you will be allotted 40 units of the scheme. Your investment grows simultaneously with the
            growth in the NAV of that mutual fund. So, if after some years the NAV of the same fund becomes Rs 35 then
            the 40 units you were allotted for Rs 1000 will be worth Rs 1400 after the increase. This way, your
            investment in the SIP continues to grow and helps you create wealth over a period of time. </p>
        <p>SIP is more of a passive investment wherein you put your money in a mutual fund, and continue to invest
            regardless of how it performs. Having said that, it is important for you to keep a close eye on the scheme
            as to how it is performing and helping you grow your money. If you are a beginner and find it perplexing,
            then it is always good to connect with a financial advisor or a broker to guide you with the best investment
            plan while doing SIP online.</p>
        <h3>What are the Benefits of Investing in SIPs?</h3>
        <p>For a true-blue investor, SIP is a blessing with a variety of benefits. Take a quick read to know in detail:
        </p>
        <h5>Works with Small Amount of Money</h5>
        <p>To begin with, all you need to do is invest a small amount on frequent intervals. It never makes you feel the
            effects of a big lump sum amount being withdrawn from your bank account every month. This will not put any
            burden on your pocket or disturb your monthly expenses or budget. Set the amount you wish to invest and fix
            a date of deduction, and the selected amount will be deducted from your bank account automatically.</p>
        <h5>Less Risk; More Discipline</h5>
        <p>With SIP, the investor gets into the habit of investing a specific amount of money consistently, which
            eventually makes him more financially disciplined. Also, this tool comes with lesser risks of loss as
            compared to the other types of investment strategies like shares and bonds.</p>
        <h5>The Cost Gets Averaged Out</h5>
        <p>The feature of Rupee Cost Averaging helps you in the upheavals of the financial markets. When the market is
            down, you can buy more units and when the market is up, you can buy less units. Therefore, whatever the
            situation, an investor is in a win-win situation. It reduces your cost of investment and provides you higher
            gains. This way your cost gets averaged out. Thus, you need not worry or fret over the ups and downs of the
            market as the cost automatically gets averaged out.</p>
        <h5>The Benefit of Compounding</h5>
        <p>When you invest your money in a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP), you are entitled to receive compound
            interest on your investments. Compounding takes place when your returns are also reinvested. For instance,
            suppose you have invested 1 lakh in a mutual fund and get 18% return in one year, then by the end of the
            year the total amount will be 1 lakh 18 thousand. When you invest for an extended period of time, you gain
            maximum gain. A one-time investment never fetches you better returns but SIP operates on a different
            principle and that’s how the power of compounding helps you grow your money exponentially. </p>
        <h5>Flexibility</h5>
        <p>SIP provides you with the leeway to choose the fund based on its performance and also withdraw the amount
            from the fund if you think it is not performing as per the expectations. Also, the amount you invest for the
            number of years is flexible as it solely depends on your personal capacity to invest and financial goals.
        </p>
        <h5>Serves as an Emergency Fund</h5>
        <p>Being an open-ended fund without any tenor, you can easily withdraw your SIP investment if there is any
            emergency. From medical emergencies to children’s higher education, this disciplined approach will support
            you throughout.</p>
        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>SIP has become investors’ favourite mode of investment in recent years as it helps them achieve their future
            financial goals without straining wallets. Before you invest, do profound research and then only select the
            fund as per your investment horizon. Maintain regularity in paying the selected amount every month and
            forget it for several years to accumulate long-term wealth. </p>
